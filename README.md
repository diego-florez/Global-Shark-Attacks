# Global-Shark-Attacks

# Intro:
In this repository you can see a 2 steps process; data cleaning and data analysis of the csv file "Global Sharck Attacks".
The source of the file can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks

# Goals:
The main goal of this project is to answer the question: which are the most dangerous sharks?

# Steps:
To find the answer to that question we have made the following steps:
1. INPUT (download original csv)
2. src (create functions to apply)
3. global-sharks-attack-cleaning.ipynb (data cleaning)
4. OUTPUT (cleaned csv)
5. global-sharks-attack-analysis.ipynb (analysis and conclusion)

# Conclusion:
Which sharks are the most dangerous?
Well, it depends;
If we talk about total amount of attacks and deaths, the winner is the white
However if we talk about probability of dying if you are attacked by a shark, the most dangerous is the zambesi, but is has only 29 attacks (10 deaths)

So is the white the most dangerous by far? No
Actually the tiger shark has 25% of deaths out of its attacks, while the white has 23%
and as the tiger is the 2nd in terms of total attacks and deaths, it should be considered as well as
1 of the monst dangerous sharks, just after the white. 

Most dangerous sharks:
1. White shark
2. Tiger shark
